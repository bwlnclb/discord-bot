In order to get started using this bot, you must first create an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy the token that can be found after creating a Bot user. The token that you have just copied will be put into the ``config.json`` file and any other information that you would like to add can also be added at that moment, such as the name and description of the bot.
